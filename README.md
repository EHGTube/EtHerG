# EtHerG

To Do : 
11. Add Internationalization
12. Fix Sending InfluxDB Alarm2 ?
13. Maybe try figuring out how to see if the influxdb connection is established. 
14. Do all formatting when everything is done


Regarding InfluxDB:

Saving Changed Parameters works
It will set Alarm1 to True when the Alarm is active. 
For some reason Alarm2 will not be send.
