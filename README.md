# EtHerG

To Do : 

12. Fix Sending InfluxDB Alarm2 ?
	1. 
13. Maybe try figuring out how to see if the influxdb connection is established. 

14. Do all formatting when everything is done (TAB USAGE!)

15. Add Mouse Controls for Value Fields




Regarding InfluxDB:

Saving Changed Parameters works

It will set Alarm1 to True when the Alarm is active. 

For some reason Alarm2 will not be send.
